# Fundatmentals of Visualization Final Project
This final project consists of the below two .Rmd files, which demonstrates my ability to create a reproducible report showing the steps 
I completed in the data anlysis process of the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering
COVID-19 Time series summary datasets.

# Steps
1. Read the Fundamentals of Visualization Final Project document for an overview of the steps completed to 
2. Download the following files:
    - IMDB_Movies_Dataset.csv
    - Week_4_FinalProjectMovies.py
4. Open the "Week_4_FinalProjectMovies.py" file using a Python compatible tool such as an IDE, Python Runner or Jupyter Notebook and run the file.
5. The Install and load the below required R packages
6. Use the knit function to process the R Markdown file. This will execute the code chunks and create the final document in the specified format (e.g., HTML, PDF).

## Required Python libraries
`pandas`
`webbrowser`
`altair`
