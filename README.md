# Fundamentals of Visualization Final Project
This final project demonstrates my ability to create and execute a project plan to create an interactive visualization to accomplish the below goals:
    - Goal #1: To discover which movies had the highest/lowest Average Rating
    - Goal #2: To see if there was any correlation between those movies with the highest Average Rating and the movie Director
The Fundamentals of Visualization document summarizes the data, goals and tasks completed, a summary of the design key elements, evaluation of the visualization approach and the findings from the 
evaluation of what went well and suggestions for future refinements.

# Steps
1. Read the Fundamentals of Visualization Final Project document for an overview of final project the steps completed to 
2. Download the following files:
    - IMDB_Movies_Dataset.csv
    - Week_4_FinalProjectMovies.py
4. Open the "Week_4_FinalProjectMovies.py" file using a Python compatible tool such as an IDE, Python Runner or Jupyter Notebook and run the file.
5. The "Top Movies with Director Filter" interactive visualization should open in a webbrowser
6. The user can now review and change the filters to see different views of the movie data.
