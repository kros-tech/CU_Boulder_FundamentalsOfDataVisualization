# Fundamentals of Visualization Final Project
This final project demonstrates my ability to design and execute a structured project plan to develop an interactive data visualization. The visualization was created to accomplish the following goals:
- **Goal #1:** To discover which movies had the highest/lowest Average Rating
- **Goal #2:** To see if there was any correlation between those movies with the highest Average Rating and the movie Director
    
The *Fundamentals of Visualization Final Project* document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including:
- A summary of the dataset
- Defined goals and analytical tasks
- Key design decisions and visualization elements
- Evaluation of the visualization approach
- Findings, including what worked well and recommendations for future improvements
    
# Steps
1. Review the *Fundamentals of Visualization Final Project* document for an overview of the project objectives, methodology, and completed steps.
2. Download the following files:
    - `IMDB_Movies_Dataset.csv`
    - `Week_4_FinalProjectMovies.py`
3. Open `Week_4_FinalProjectMovies.py` using a Python-compatible tool (such as an IDE, Python Runner, or Jupyter Notebook).
4. Run the Python file.
5. The interactive visualization titled **“Top Movies with Director Filter”** will open in your web browser.
6. Use the interactive filters to explore different views and insights within the movie dataset.
